            I set up a new research line for the lab in the game engine Unity for researching vision with the help of deep convolutional neural networks. The Unity environment is capable of generating large datasets while retaining the experimental control necessary for scientific research. I subsequently trained and investigated convolutional neural networks in PyTorch.
